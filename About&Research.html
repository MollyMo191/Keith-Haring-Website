            <p>
                The mission of the Keith Haring Foundation is to sustain, expand, and protect the legacy of Keith Haring, his art, and his ideals. The Foundation supports not-for-profit organizations that assist children, as well as organizations involved in education, prevention, and care related to AIDS.
                <br><br>Keith Haring (1958-1990) generously contributed his talents and resources to numerous causes. He conducted art workshops with children, created logos and posters for public service agencies, and produced murals, sculptures, and paintings to benefit health centers and disadvantaged communities. In 1989, Haring established a foundation to ensure that his philanthropic legacy would continue indefinitely.
                <br><br>The Keith Haring Foundation makes grants to not-for-profit groups that engage in charitable activities. In accordance with Haring’s wishes, the Foundation concentrates its giving in two areas: the support of organizations which enrich the lives of underprivileged children and the support of organizations which engage in education, prevention, and care with respect to AIDS and HIV infection. Keith Haring additionally charged the Foundation with maintaining and protecting his artistic legacy after his death. The Foundation maintains a collection of art along with archives that facilitate historical research about the artist and the times and places in which he lived and worked. The Foundation supports arts and educational institutions by funding exhibitions, programming, and publications that serve to contextualize and illuminate Haring’s work and philosophy.

                The Keith Haring Foundation maintains the world’s most comprehensive archive of materials relating to artist Keith Haring and his legacy. The collection encompasses a wide array of materials spanning over four decades and including Haring’s hand-written journals, as well as published writings by and about him, press clippings, audio/visual materials, personal memorabilia, exhibition and special project files, and other documentation and ephemera. The Keith Haring Foundation is currently in the process of cataloging and digitizing these materials to assist researchers in their scholarly pursuits and to enhance exhibitions.
                <br><br>Qualified scholars and curators can view materials by appointment. In order to qualify for access, researchers must be able to articulate a specific and relevant research goal in conversation with the Foundation’s archivist. Scholars wishing to make appointments should first familiarize themselves with the materials available through our website and other publicly available documents.
